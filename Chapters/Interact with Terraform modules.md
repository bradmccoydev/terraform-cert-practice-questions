# Where do you find and explore terraform Modules?

The Terraform Registry makes it simple to find and use modules.

The search query will look at module name, provider, and description to match your search terms. On the results page, filters can be used further refine search results.

# How do you make sure that modules have stability and compatibility?

By default, only verified modules are shown in search results. 

Verified modules are reviewed by HashiCorp to ensure stability and compatibility.

# How do you download a module?

You need to add the module in the configuration file like below
```terraform
module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"
}
```
`terraform init` command will download and cache any modules referenced by a configuration.

# What is the syntax for referencing a registry module?

`<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`
```terraform
// Example
module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"
}
```

# What is the syntax for referencing a private registry module?

`<HOSTNAME>/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>`
```terraform
// Example
module "vpc" {
  source = "app.terraform.io/example_corp/vpc/aws"
  version = "0.9.3"
}
```
# When you use remote modules what should you do if there is a change in the module?

You should reinitialize with `terraform init`.

# Why do you not have to do the command init or get every time there is a change in the local module?

When installing a local module, Terraform will refer directly to the source directory. 

Because of this, Terraform will automatically notice changes to local modules without having to re-run `terraform init` or `terraform get`.

# The terraform recommends that all modules must follow semantic versioning. Is this true?

True

# What is a Terraform Module?

A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory. Even a simple configuration consisting of a single directory with one or more `.tf` files is a module.

# Why do we use modules for?

- Organize configuration
- Encapsulate configuration
- Re-use configuration
- Provide consistency and ensure best practices

# How do you call modules in your configuration?

You call a module block, and pass in the source directory path.
```terraform
module "azurerm_resource_group" {
  source = "./modules/azure/azurerm_resource_group"

  # ...
}
```

# What is the required argument for a module?

`source`

All modules require a source argument, which is a meta-argument defined by Terraform CLI. Its value is either the path to a local directory of the module's configuration files, or a remote module source that Terraform should download and use. This value must be a literal string with no template sequences.

# How many ways you can load modules?

Local and remote modules.

Modules can either be loaded from the local filesystem, or a remote source. 

Terraform supports a variety of remote sources, including the Terraform Registry, most version control systems, HTTP URLs, and Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise private module registries.

# When using a new module for the first time, you must run either terraform init or terraform get to install the module. Is this true?

True. When installing a remote module, Terraform will download it into the `.terraform` directory in your configuration's root directory. When installing a local module, Terraform will instead refer directly to the source directory.

# Where does terraform save remote modules?

`.terraform/modules`
```
// Example.terraform/modules
├── ec2_instances
│   └── terraform-aws-modules-terraform-aws-ec2-instance-ed6dcd9
├── modules.json
└── vpc
    └── terraform-aws-modules-terraform-aws-vpc-2417f60
 ```

# What are the best practices for using Modules?

1. Start writing your configuration with modules in mind. Even for modestly complex Terraform configurations managed by a single person, you'll find the benefits of using modules outweigh the time it takes to use them properly.

2. Use local modules to organize and encapsulate your code. Even if you aren't using or publishing remote modules, organizing your configuration in terms of modules from the beginning will significantly reduce the burden of maintaining and updating your configuration as your infrastructure grows in complexity.

3. Use the public Terraform Registry to find useful modules. This way you can more quickly and confidently implement your configuration by relying on the work of others to implement common infrastructure scenarios.

4. Publish and share modules with your team. Most infrastructure is managed by a team of people, and modules are important way that teams can work together to create and maintain infrastructure. As mentioned earlier, you can publish modules either publicly or privately.

# What are the different source types for calling modules?

- Local paths
- Terraform Registry
- GitHub
- Generic Git, Mercurial repositories
- Bitbucket
- HTTP URLs
- S3 buckets
- GCS buckets

# How do you set input variables for the modules?

The configuration that calls a module is responsible for setting its input values, which are passed as arguments in the module block. 
```terraform
module "azurerm_resource_group" {
  source = "./modules/azure/azurerm_resource_group"

  name     = "mla-${var.client_environment}-${var.client_project_id}"
  location = var.cloud_location_1
  tags     = var.tags
}
```
This example sets the input variables for name, location, and tags.

# How do you access output variables from the modules?

`module.<MODULE NAME>.<OUTPUT NAME>`

eg: `module.azurerm_resource_group.id`

# Where do you put output variables in the configuration?

Inside your configuration's directory, `outputs.tf` will need to contain an output block such as below:
```terraform
output "id" {
  description = "Resource group ID"
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.default.id
}
```
# How do you pass input variables in the configuration?

You can define variables in `variables.tf` in the root folder.
```terraform
variable "cloud_location_1" {
  description = "Cloud Location (region)"
  type        = string
}
```
Which can then be access in the configuration like this:
```terraform
module "azurerm_resource_group" {
  source = "./modules/azure/azurerm_resource_group"

  location = var.cloud_location_1
  # ...
}
```
# What is the child module?

A module that is called by another configuration is referred to as a "child module" of that configuration.
